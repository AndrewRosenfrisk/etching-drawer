# Etching Drawer

## About

When you move a pen point around the screen with the WASD keys, the 
etching drawer forms a picture by tracing a continuous line, like the 
Etch A Sketch toy. Let your artistic side break out and see what images 
you can create! This program also lets you save your drawings to a text 
file so you can print them out later. Plus, you can copy and paste the 
WASD movements of other drawings into this program, like the WASD commands 
for the Hilbert Curve fractal presented on lines 6 to 14 of the source code.
